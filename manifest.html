<h1>About Amateur Radio</h1>

<h2>How I understand the goals</h2>

<p>Radio amateurs practice communication by electromagnetic interaction to</p>

<ul>
<li>have fun,</li>
<li>learn technical skills and knowledge about electronics and propagation,</li>
<li>improve operational skills concerning organization and procedures,</li>
<li>take care of the commons of the electromagnetic spectrum,</li>
<li>support their human fellows near and far in mutual understanding.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I like most in amateur radio</h2>

<ul>
<li>Morse code transmission with simple and low-power equipment</li>
<li>analog modes where I am as close as possible to the radio waves</li>
<li>chatting with fellows, without intermediate networks</li>
</ul>
