<h1>About Amateur Radio</h1>

<h2>How I understand the goals</h2>

<p>Radio amateurs practice communication by electromagnetic interaction for</p>

<ul>
<li>their personal pleasure,</li>
<li>learning technical skills and knowledge about electronics and propagation,</li>
<li>improving operational skills concerning organization and procedures,</li>
<li>facilitating mutual understanding of their human fellows near and far.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I like in amateur radio</h2>

<ul>
<li>Morse code transmission with simple and low-power equipment</li>
<li>analog modes where I am as close as possible to the radio waves</li>
<li>chatting with fellows, without intermediate networks</li>
</ul>
