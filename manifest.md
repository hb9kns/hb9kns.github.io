# About Amateur Radio

## How I understand the goals

Radio amateurs practice communication by electromagnetic interaction to

- have fun,
- learn technical skills and knowledge about electronics and propagation,
- improve operational skills concerning organization and procedures,
- take care of the commons of the electromagnetic spectrum,
- support their human fellows near and far in mutual understanding.

## What I like most in amateur radio

- Morse code transmission with simple and low-power equipment
- analog modes where I am as close as possible to the radio waves
- chatting with fellows, without intermediate networks
