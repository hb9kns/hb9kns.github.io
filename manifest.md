# About Amateur Radio

## How I understand the goals

Radio amateurs practice communication by electromagnetic interaction for

- their personal pleasure,
- learning technical skills and knowledge about electronics and propagation,
- improving operational skills concerning organization and procedures,
- facilitating mutual understanding of their human fellows near and far.

## What I like in amateur radio

- Morse code transmission with simple and low-power equipment
- analog modes where I am as close as possible to the radio waves
- chatting with fellows, without intermediate networks
