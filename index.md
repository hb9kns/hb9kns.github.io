## Ham radio logbook

You can read my amateur radio logbook in [HTML]( hamlog.html )
or [Markdown/text]( hamlog.md ) format.

(The HTML may be out of date for up to a day, as I cannot generate it from all mobile devices. The Markdown version always will be up to date.)

_The logbook remains under copyright, i.e the CC license valid elsewhere does not apply here!_
